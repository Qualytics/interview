# Full Stack Challenge

* Discover an open source dataset ([example](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/search?collection=Dataset)), available for query through an API.
* Create a Python or Scala application that queries the API and delivers it to a UI through a web service. Consider how to make responses fast, but also keep the content fresh.
* Design a simple UI to display the content. A heavily designed UI is not required, but you will get bonus points for using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or React.
* Demonstrate how to deliver and deploy using a Docker image. Bonus points for using [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/). Extra bonus points for demonstrating how to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster.
