# DevOps Challenge

* Use Terraform to create a cluster on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
* Include a pod that runs [Meltano](https://meltano.com/) and uses an Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for application data storage
[See Meltano database configuration settings](https://meltano.com/docs/settings.html#database-uri).
* (Note: Using Meltano to execute an ELT job is out of scope.)
* Package the code so that we can run the application on our own instance.
